3 streams Arts Science & Commerce and we are creating data for the Science Stream and that too for the  IT Department that has Degrees Bachelor of Science in Information and Technology(BScIT) and Master of Science in Information & Technology (MScIT).
BScIT is a 3 year programme that is divided into 3 classes that is First Year(FY) Second Year(SY) Third Year(TY) and all together each Class has 2 Semester which make overall Semesters being 6 and each Semester has 5 subjects and Each Subject has 5 Units so in together there are 30 Subjects and in the BScIT programme.
